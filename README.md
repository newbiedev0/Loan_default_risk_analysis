# Loan Default Risk Analytics Dashboard

Interactive business intelligence dashboard analyzing loan portfolio risk and borrower default behavior using Power BI.

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes a large loan portfolio dataset to identify high-risk borrower segments and key drivers of default. The dashboard provides decision-support insights for risk monitoring, segmentation, and portfolio health evaluation.

The goal is to simulate a real-world credit risk analytics solution used by financial institutions.

---

##  Business Objective

Enable lenders and risk managers to:

- Monitor overall portfolio default risk
- Identify high-risk borrower segments
- Compare risk across regions and loan characteristics
- Understand relationships between credit strength and leverage
- Support data-driven lending decisions

---

## Key Metrics

- Portfolio Default Rate
- Average Loan-to-Value (LTV)
- Average Borrower Credit Score
- Total Active Loans
- Risk Segment Contribution
- Default Rate by Borrower Profile

---

##  Dashboard Structure

### Page 1 — Portfolio Risk Overview
- KPI summary of portfolio health
- Default risk by loan purpose
- Regional comparison of default rates
- Default risk across credit score segments
- Risk segment contribution (High Risk vs Normal)

### Page 2 — Risk Driver Analysis
- Relationship between credit score and leverage
- Default risk by income group
- Default risk by age group
- Default risk by occupancy type

---

## Key Insights

- Portfolio default rate is approximately 25%
- Certain regions show higher risk concentration
- Higher leverage is associated with elevated default risk
- Borrower segmentation reveals meaningful risk variation
- Loan purpose influences default behavior

---

## Tools & Technologies

- python/pandas preprocessing handling of missing values using imputation and removing unwanted columns
- Power BI (Data Modeling & Visualization)
- DAX (Calculated Measures & Segmentation)
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Business Intelligence Design Principles
